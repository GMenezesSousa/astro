Codes used in the course of my time as an astronomy student.

Here are some of the codes I created during my time as a student of astronomy on the Institute of Astronomy, Geology and Atmospheric Sciences of the University of São Paulo.
Some of the codes are very simple, coded during my first classes of Introduction to Computer Science, some are more astronomy-oriented, made during my time as a research student
under the orientation of Dr. Jane Gregório-Hetem.
